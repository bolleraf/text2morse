This is a simple text converter to morse code. This was made as an exercise part of my learning path to master Python :-)

## Getting started

This project started as part of a curriculum I followed to learn about Python programming. I wanted to make a small utility
to convert a string into a morse code sequence. I mainly did the job with the use of dictionary. I also used **argparse**
module to make use of the arguments in the command line.

### Pre-requisites

- Python 3


### Installation

Simply download the script text2morse.py. No dependencies are required


## How to run

 Run in the command line ``text2morse -t "your text to convert"`` 

## Made with
